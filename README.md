### Theme

The theme of this jam was **dimensions**.

Our challenge with this project was to make a game that switches between a 2 dimensional game and a 3 dimensional world.

We used a RayCaster to simulate a 3D environment.

We also wanted to make use of all the features of the RayCaster by making a non-euclidian game,
but we didn't have enough time to implement all our ideas.

### Gameplay

We're playing as a kid in his house.
During the night, the kid is having a nightmare, and he sees the monster from the game he was playing.

The original idea was to make him progress in his house, and he was supposed to hide from the monster.
The player would've been able to look for items that could help him beat the monster.

For the Jam, we had to change our ideas to be able to finish the game in less than a week.
